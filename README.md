Crop disease is the most significant contributor to loss of yield while also threatening food security and quality. Plant diseases account for approximately a 20-30% plant productivity lossÂ which translates to billions of dollars of economic loss.
The current process of detecting plant disease/weed is manual and very labor intensive and costly and diseased crops could easily be overlooked

Idea is to Automate the process of plant disease detection by analyzing the images of plants with the help of artificial intelligence techniques (neural networks). The neural network will be trained on approximately 60,000 images of wide variety of healthy and diseased plants for it to provide a near accurate prediction.

Technical solution Details -
15 classes of diseased and healthy crops has been fed to a concolutional neural network. To augment the image set, rotation, flipping, resizing of the images has been done to generalize and guard against any biases.

I have used Vgg16 architecture here to arrive at a train and test accuracy of 90%.
